Hello I'm Mofe, a Computer Science Master's student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html). My research focuses on Information Retrieval (IR), Low-Resource NLP and Multilingual language models.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Systems Engineering from the [University of Lagos](https://unilag.edu.ng/). Prior to starting my Master's program, I was opportuned to join [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/), an NLP research community for African languages and began working on projects to advance state of the art for African languages in NLP.
