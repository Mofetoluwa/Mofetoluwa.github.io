Hello, I'm Mofe. I completed my Master's degree from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html). My work focuses on Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multilingual models.

Before that, I received my Bachelor's in Systems Engineering from the [University of Lagos](https://unilag.edu.ng/). Prior to starting my Master's program, I was opportune to join [Masakhane](https://www.masakhane.io/), an NLP research community for African languages and began working on projects to advance state-of-the-art for African languages in NLP.
